# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering.
This is a Machine Learning Project which uses unsupervised learning algorithm K-means clustering to segment the users based on different features .

**Algorithm Selection**
Selected K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.
Ideal for grouping unlabeled data based on similarity without predefined categories.
Suitable for customer segmentation as it forms natural clusters based on behavior.

**Data Input**
Used two key features from the dataset:
Annual Income
Spending Score
These attributes were chosen for their relevance in understanding purchasing patterns


**Training Process**
Data was preprocessed and normalized.
Used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters(value of k).
Applied the K-means algorithm from the scikit-learn library to fit the model.

**Segmentation Output**
The trained model assigned each customer to one of the defined clusters.
Cluster groups were visualized using scatter plots to interpret customer segments.
